# Human-Activity-Recognition-System
Human activity recognition system using Mediapipe, numpy and OpenCV libraries.



Problem Statement 
The problem statement is that there’s a lack of human activity recognition systems that works on images and video that’s accessible to people and not large corporations. 

Our project aims to showcase that on human activity recognition can be achieved without the use of expensive and complex computing systems but by using a Python library and simple code logic.

Existing and Proposed System 
Existing solutions are limited to large corporations that use expensive hardware, complex solutions and large amounts of engineering hours

Proposed system uses python and freely available solutions that is accessible to all. Users just have to create a logic and put it to use.


Module Description 
Numpy: library used to run calculations and other numerical data manipulation
Opencv: library used to input, manipulate and output  image and video data
Mediapipe pose: a solution within mediapipe that provides landmarks of human body coordinates 
Result and Conclusion
We implemented logic to accurately identify 4 human activities – standing, walking, sitting and waving

Therefore, we conclude that human activity recognition can be accessed without the use of expensive and complex systems.
